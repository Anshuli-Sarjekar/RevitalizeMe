        <h2 class="faq-question">How to Increase BMR?</h2>
        <div id="faq-item-1" class="content" onclick="event.stopPropagation()">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Eating More Protein in Every Meal:</strong> Protein is an essential macronutrient that plays a crucial role in various physiological functions. It is particularly important for muscle repair, growth, and maintenance. When you consume more protein, it helps in the synthesis of new muscle proteins, which can contribute to an increase in lean muscle mass. Since muscle tissue burns more calories than fat tissue, having a higher proportion of muscle can potentially boost your metabolism, aiding in weight management.</li>

                <li><strong>Doing More HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) Workouts:</strong> HIIT involves short bursts of intense exercise followed by periods of rest or lower-intensity activity. This type of workout has been shown to increase the afterburn effect, scientifically known as excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). EPOC refers to the additional calories your body continues to burn after the workout is completed. The intense nature of HIIT can lead to an increased metabolic rate, helping you burn more calories during and after the exercise session.</li>

                <li><strong>Increasing Your Daily Activity - Choosing Stairs, Walking More, Using a Standing Desk:</strong> Non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) refers to the calories your body burns during activities that are not formal exercise. Choosing stairs, walking more, and using a standing desk increase your NEAT. These activities may seem small, but they can have a cumulative effect on the calories burned throughout the day. Additionally, standing and walking engage more muscles than sitting, contributing to overall energy expenditure.</li>

                <li><strong>Eating More Spicy Foods:</strong> Spicy foods often contain compounds like capsaicin, which can temporarily boost metabolism. Capsaicin has been shown to increase the body's heat production, leading to a slight increase in calorie expenditure. While the effect may not be massive, regularly incorporating spicy foods into your diet may contribute to a modest increase in overall calorie burning.</li>

                <li><strong>Doing More Resistance Workouts - Muscles Burn More Calories Than Fat Tissue:</strong> Muscle tissue is metabolically active, meaning it requires energy (calories) to function even at rest. When you engage in resistance workouts and build muscle mass, your body's overall calorie expenditure increases because maintaining and repairing muscle tissue demands energy. In contrast, fat tissue is less metabolically active. Therefore, having a higher proportion of lean muscle mass can contribute to a higher resting metabolic rate, supporting weight management efforts.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's important to note that individual responses to these strategies may vary, and a holistic approach to diet and exercise is often most effective for achieving and maintaining overall health and fitness goals. Consulting with a healthcare or fitness professional is advisable before making significant changes to your diet or exercise routine.</p>

    <div class="faq-item" onclick="toggleDropdown('faq-item-2')">
        <h2 class="faq-question">How to boost your overall metabolism?</h2>
        <div id="faq-item-2" class="content" onclick="event.stopPropagation()">
            <p>Supporting your metabolism is key to maintaining a healthy lifestyle, as it is responsible for converting nutrients into the energy your body needs for essential functions. Factors such as age, diet, physical activity, and health status can influence your metabolic rate.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Eat Plenty of Protein at Every Meal:</strong>
                    Eating protein-rich foods temporarily increases your metabolism due to the thermic effect of food (TEF). Protein requires more energy for digestion compared to carbohydrates and fats. Additionally, a higher protein intake can help prevent muscle loss during weight loss, supporting your metabolism.</li>

                <li><strong>Do a High-Intensity Workout:</strong>
                    High-intensity interval training (HIIT) involves intense bursts of activity, effectively boosting your metabolism. This type of exercise helps burn fat and build muscle, contributing to an increased metabolic rate, especially when compared to other exercise types.</li>

                <li><strong>Lift Heavy Things:</strong>
                    Building muscle through weightlifting increases your metabolism, as muscle is more metabolically active than fat. Lifting weights not only helps you burn more calories at rest but also prevents muscle loss during weight loss, maintaining a higher metabolism.</li>

                <li><strong>Stand Up More:</strong>
                    Prolonged sitting can negatively impact your metabolism and health. Standing or incorporating short walks throughout the day can mitigate these effects, improving cardiometabolic health and reducing the risk of weight gain.</li>

                <li><strong>Drink Green Tea or Oolong Tea:</strong>
                    Green tea and oolong tea contain compounds that may increase fat burning, contributing to a higher metabolism. The teas may also influence the gut microbiome, improving the breakdown of fats for energy.</li>

                <li><strong>Eat Spicy Foods:</strong>
                    Spices like peppers, containing capsaicin, can boost metabolism. While the effect may be modest, incorporating spicy foods into your diet, combined with other strategies, may contribute to maintaining a moderate weight.</li>

                <li><strong>Get a Good Night’s Sleep:</strong>
                    Lack of sleep is linked to obesity and can disrupt appetite-regulating hormones. Quality sleep is crucial for maintaining a healthy metabolism and supporting weight management.</li>

                <li><strong>Drink Coffee:</strong>
                    Caffeine in coffee triggers the release of neurotransmitters that regulate fat processing, leading to increased metabolism. While the effectiveness may vary, coffee consumption can contribute to weight loss, especially when combined with a healthy lifestyle.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In summary, incorporating these strategies into your daily routine can enhance your metabolism, support weight management, and contribute to overall health. Whether through dietary choices, exercise, or lifestyle adjustments, these evidence-based methods provide effective ways to boost your metabolism.</p>
