            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In today's fast-paced world, our lifestyle choices play a significant role in shaping our health and overall well-being. Lifestyle disorders, also known as non-communicable diseases (NCDs), are a collection of health conditions intricately tied to the choices we make daily. Unlike diseases linked to genetics or infections, lifestyle disorders derive their name from the intimate connection between our daily decisions and their impact on our health. These disorders beckon us to take control of our lives and make informed choices that lead to better health and longevity.        </p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="lifestyle-types" id="types">
            <h2>Common Lifestyle Disorders:</h2>
            <h3>Diabetes: Managing the Sweet Challenge</h3>
            <p>Diabetes is a lifestyle disorder that calls for diligent management of blood sugar levels. It demands careful attention to dietary habits, physical activity, and stress management. Lifestyle modifications, including a balanced, nutrient-rich diet, regular exercise, and the avoidance of detrimental habits, empower individuals to take charge of their health. Preventing diabetes and managing it effectively are achievable through informed lifestyle choices.</p>
            <h3>Hypertension: Controlling the Silent Killer</h3>
            <p>Hypertension, often referred to as the "silent killer," silently affects millions of lives worldwide. Lifestyle choices, such as a diet high in sodium, sedentary behavior, and unmanaged stress, contribute to this condition. Taking control of hypertension involves adopting a heart-healthy lifestyle, which includes reducing salt intake, regular physical activity, and stress management techniques. These proactive measures can help individuals maintain healthy blood pressure levels.</p>
            <h3>Cancer: Reducing Risks through Lifestyle
            </h3>
            <p>Cancer, a complex group of diseases, is not solely dictated by genetics. Lifestyle factors, such as tobacco use, unhealthy diets, exposure to carcinogens, and a lack of physical activity, can elevate cancer risks. By making informed choices, such as quitting tobacco, embracing a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, and maintaining a healthy weight, individuals can significantly reduce their risk of cancer and contribute to their overall well-being.
            </p>
            <h3>PCOD: Balancing Hormones through Lifestyle
            </h3>
            <p>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOD) affects many women and can disrupt hormonal balance. A lifestyle approach focused on maintaining a healthy weight, dietary choices that support hormonal balance, and regular exercise can help manage PCOD symptoms and improve quality of life.
            </p>
            <h3>Heart Attack: Protecting the Heart</h3>
            <p>Heart attacks often result from poor lifestyle choices, including a high-sugar diet, sedentary behavior, and smoking. Taking care of one's heart involves adopting a heart-healthy diet, engaging in regular physical activity, and avoiding habits that endanger heart health. By doing so, individuals can significantly reduce the risk of heart attacks and maintain robust cardiovascular health.
            </p>
            <h3>Thyroid Disorders: Balancing Metabolism
            </h3>
            <p>Disorders of the thyroid gland can lead to hormonal imbalances affecting metabolism. A healthy lifestyle encompassing a nutrient-rich diet, exercise, and proper stress management can be instrumental in managing thyroid conditions and promoting overall well-being.
            </p>
            <h3>Fatty Liver Disease: Lifestyle Interventions
            </h3>
            <p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely associated with obesity and unhealthy dietary choices. Weight management and dietary adjustments can help individuals reverse the effects of fatty liver disease and preserve liver health.
            </p>
            <h3>Obesity: Transforming Lives through Lifestyle
            </h3>
            <p>Obesity is a complex lifestyle disorder, often resulting from an imbalance between calorie intake and expenditure. Effective weight management strategies involve adopting a balanced diet, increasing physical activity, and seeking professional guidance to create sustainable changes.
