            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Cancer is a complex group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells in the body. These abnormal cells, often referred to as cancer cells, can invade and destroy nearby healthy tissues and organs. They can also potentially spread to other parts of the body through the blood and lymphatic systems, a process known as metastasis.</p>
                <p>Cancer can affect people of all ages and backgrounds and can occur in various parts of the body. There are many different types of cancer, each with its own unique characteristics and treatment options. The development of cancer is often attributed to genetic mutations, environmental factors, lifestyle choices, and a combination of these elements.</p>
                <p>The understanding of cancer, its prevention, and treatment has advanced significantly over the years, leading to improved outcomes for many individuals diagnosed with the disease. Early detection, timely medical interventions, and ongoing research continue to play a crucial role in the fight against cancer.</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3>Breast Cancer</h3>
                  <p>Breast cancer primarily affects women but can occur in men. It originates in the breast tissue, often manifesting as a lump or changes in breast size.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3>Prostate Cancer</h3>

                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3>Liver Cancer</h3>
                  <p>Liver cancer begins in the liver and is often linked to chronic liver diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatitis B or C. Symptoms may include abdominal pain and weight loss. Treatment options vary, including surgery, liver transplant, and targeted drug therapy.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3>Stomach Cancer</h3>
                  <p>Stomach cancer, or gastric cancer, starts in the stomach lining. It's associated with symptoms like indigestion, abdominal discomfort, and unexplained weight loss. Treatment typically involves surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3>Ovarian Cancer</h3>
                  <p>Ovarian cancer is specific to women and begins in the ovaries. Early detection is challenging, but common symptoms include abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in urination. Treatment comprises surgery and chemotherapy.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3>Pancreatic Cancer</h3>
                  <p>Pancreatic cancer originates in the pancreas, and it's often diagnosed at advanced stages. Symptoms include jaundice, abdominal pain, and unexplained weight loss. Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3>Thyroid Cancer</h3>
                  <p>Thyroid cancer occurs in the thyroid gland, leading to symptoms like neck lumps and difficulty swallowing. The primary treatment is surgery to remove the thyroid or part of it, with potential follow-up radioactive iodine therapy.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3>Kidney Cancer</h3>

                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3>Brain Cancer</h3>
                  <p>Brain cancer can develop in various parts of the brain, leading to symptoms like headaches, seizures, and neurological deficits. Treatment options encompass surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, depending on the tumor's type and location.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3>Esophageal Cancer</h3>

            <h2>Prevention: Reducing Your Risk of Cancer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Healthy Lifestyle:</strong> Adopt a healthy lifestyle that includes regular physical activity, a balanced diet, and maintaining a healthy weight. Engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week.</li>
                <li><strong>Balanced Diet:</strong> Consume a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Reduce your intake of sugary drinks and processed foods. Limit your consumption of red and processed meats. Aim to include a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables in your daily meals.</li>
                <li><strong>Sun Protection:</strong> Protect your skin from harmful UV radiation. Use sunscreen with a broad spectrum (SPF 30 or higher), wear protective clothing, and seek shade during peak sun hours. Perform regular skin self-examinations to detect any unusual skin changes or growths.</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Screenings:</strong> Follow recommended cancer screenings based on your age, gender, and family history. Screenings can help detect cancer at an early, more treatable stage. Common screenings include mammograms, Pap tests, colonoscopies, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests.</li>
                <li><strong>Vaccinations:</strong> Consider vaccinations that can prevent certain cancers. For example, HPV vaccines can protect against cervical, anal, and other cancers. Hepatitis B vaccination reduces the risk of liver cancer.</li>
                <li><strong>Limit Alcohol:</strong> If you choose to consume alcohol, do so in moderation. For women, this means up to one drink per day, and for men, up to two drinks per day. Excessive alcohol consumption is a risk factor for liver, breast, mouth, and other cancers.</li>
                <li><strong>Tobacco-Free:</strong> Quit smoking and avoid exposure to secondhand smoke. Smoking is a major cause of lung, mouth, throat, and other cancers. Seek support and resources to help you quit if you're a smoker.</li>
                <li><strong>Occupational Safety:</strong> If your work involves exposure to carcinogens or toxins, follow recommended safety guidelines. Use protective equipment and practices to reduce exposure to workplace hazards associated with increased cancer risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Awareness:</strong> Stay informed about potential environmental factors and toxins in your living and working environments that may increase cancer risk. Take necessary precautions to minimize exposure, such as reducing exposure to air pollutants or hazardous chemicals.</li>
                <li><strong>Infectious Diseases:</strong> Protect against infections associated with cancer. Consider vaccination for hepatitis B and C to reduce the risk of liver cancer. Practice safe sex and get vaccinated against HPV to reduce the risk of cervical and other cancers.</li>
            </ul>
