## Requirements
- To set up the project locally, refer to the instructions in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

## How to run?
- Ensure that you have your own API key for API-Ninja database access required in app.py. 
- You have setup to any RDBMS (get hostname, root, password) for flask SQLAlchemy connection(defined as db in app.py)
- The API key and databse details are mentioned in the .env file which can be directly defined in the app.py(For me it is stored in .env file).
- I have a recipes data that I obtained from web scraping and NLP based text transformation techniques using Parrot Library. Yu can create your own recipes data. The columns of these are: recipe_id, Recipe Name,	Prep Time,	Cook Time,	Meal Types,	Dietary Types,	Calories,	Fat,	Carbohydrate,	Protein,	Ingredients,	steps,	Serving Size.
- Once all the above is set, you can run app.py and look up to the RevitalizeMe website.

The purpose of this project is purely academic and educational, aimed at showcasing knowledge and practical application of web development principles for educational purposes only.
